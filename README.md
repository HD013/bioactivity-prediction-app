# bioactivity-prediction-app

Here is a sample Bioactivicty Predictor App

This app takes data from the CHEMBL database and predicts the likely bioactivity of specific molecules including accounting for the chirality of the molecules. To use the app simply upload a (CSV) file with the SMILES and PI50 data for the molecule class.
